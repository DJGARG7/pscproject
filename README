*How to run the CHATBOT*

1) We have used tensorflow in the backend so you will have to run it in python 3.6 environment (since tensorflow is not availible in python 3.7 yet).
2) Install keras, nltk, json, pickle and tensorflow in the 3.6 environment.
3) Download wordnet and punkt by nltk.download('wordnet') and nltk.download('punkt')
4) Run the file 'train_chatbot.py' to train the model from 'intents.json' to create 3 layer neural network
5) Now run the file named 'chatgui.py' and the chatbot will be on your screen and u can start interacting with it.
